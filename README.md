4. [Dijkstra Goal Detection Algorithm (w/ Clearance Visualization): ](https://github.com/rpande1996/Dijkstra_Goal_Detection_Rigid)
This repository utilizes Dijkstra algorithm for a rigid robot with user-inputted robot radius, robot clearance, start location and goal location. The exploration around the obstacles is avoided according to the clearance.

5. [Dijkstra Goal Detection Algorithm (w/o Clearance Visualization): ](https://github.com/rpande1996/Dijkstra_Goal_Detection_Algorithm)
This repository utilizes Dijkstra algorithm for a rigid robot with user-inputted robot radius, robot clearance, start location and goal location. The obstacles are padded with a layer of clearance.

7. [Autonomous World Navigation](https://github.com/rpande1996/Autonomous_World_Navigation)
This repository utilizes in-built turtlebot planner to send a explorer robot to scan the QR codes at predefined locations and then send the follower robot to visit the same locations in ascending order
